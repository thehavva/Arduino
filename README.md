**What is Ardunio?**<br/>
Arduino is a physical programming platform consisting of an I/O board and a development environment that includes an implementation of the Processing/Wiring language.

The hardware of Arduino boards includes an Atmel AVR microcontroller (such as ATmega328, ATmega2560, ATmega32u4) and necessary peripherals for programming and connection to other circuits. Every Arduino board has at least one 5 volt regulated IC and a 16MHz crystal oscillator (some ceramic resonator). An external programmer is not needed for programming on Arduino boards, because a bootloader program is written to the microcontroller on the board.
<br/><br/>**What can be done with Arduino?**<br/>
You can easily program with Arduino libraries. You can receive and process analog and digital signals. Using signals from sensors, you can design robots and systems that interact with the environment. You can create reactions to the outside world, such as movement, sound and light, specific to the project you are designing.

Arduino has various cards and modules designed to produce solutions for different needs. You can develop your projects using these cards and modules.
<br/><br/>I wanted to make preliminary preparations to meet microprocessors, which are indispensable for electronic engineering. I learned that we can do many projects with the small and few materials we have and I became interested in ardunio. The first youtube link I followed when I started was the following, along with my mother tongue Turkish:

Secondly, the foreign channel I would recommend is: [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdXQUEMOfgU&list=PLPK2l9Knytg5s2dk8V09thBmNl2g5pRSr).
The arduino codes, which we will go from the simplest to the most difficult, are located in this folder.
